/**
 * Library-wide data structures.
 *
 * This module defines generic objects, containers to store objects, observers to react
 * to modifications of the containers.
 *
 * These are used in other modules to define concrete objects and containers such as vertices,
 * edges, and graphs.
 *
 * This module also defines a tabular representation of data (Property Matrix) used to compute
 * statistical summaries.
 *
 * History:
 * - 2018.01.01 file adapted from version 1.0 of the multinet library
