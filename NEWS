# version 0.7.2

- Minor modification to parser for CRAN compatibility

# version 0.7.1

- Minor modification to external library for CRAN compatibility

# version 0.7

- Added weighted Louvain and Generalised Louvain. Weighted are automatically considered if present.

- Added resolution parameter to Louvain and Generalised Louvain.

# version 0.6.3

- Updated layer degree correlation: the correlation is now computed on the degree, not the number of neighbours. That is, if a vertex V has two incident edges V -> U and V <- U, its degree with mode INOUT is 2 (it was previously 1, as the neighbour is the same). 

- Updated clique percolation: fixed a missing duplicate check (potentially leading to redundant sub-communities being returned) and now automatically discarding directionality if executed on a directed graph.
