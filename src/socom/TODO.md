# Intro

This folder contains all the code related with the development of the social
communication library, or socom.

There a couple of things I want to make sure the lib does:

- Contrsuct and maintain a temporal text network model
- Add context to the temporal text network model
- Add nodes, actors and edges to the network
- Add and maintain properties of the network
- Add and maintain features to the network
- Query the network in multiple ways, e.g., by looking at history of items.

The difficulty is to manage the different types of objects we must follow.
